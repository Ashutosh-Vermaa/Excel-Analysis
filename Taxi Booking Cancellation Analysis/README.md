-Rides with assigned drivers have a longer average cancellation time (233.9 sec) than rides without drivers (110.4 sec).	

-Most cancellations of rides with assigned drivers occur at around 8 PM, indicating customers are unwilling to wait between 8-9 PM.		

-The highest number of cancellations occur at 8 AM, followed by the last 3 hours of the day, and cancellations decline between 12 AM to 7 AM.		

-8 AM has the highest estimated time of arrival (ETA), which may be the reason for the most cancellations at that time.		

-Customers cancel more rides without assigned drivers than with assigned drivers.		

-The number of cancellations is positively correlated with the number of offers given. The highest number of cancellations at 8 AM may be due to the highest 

number of offers given at that time. Another reason could be the highest ETA during the day.
